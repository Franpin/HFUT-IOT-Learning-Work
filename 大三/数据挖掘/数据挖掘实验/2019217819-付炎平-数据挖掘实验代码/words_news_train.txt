obedience Obedience solely a matter compliancerefusal The nature commands account someones compliance refusal obedient disobedient You consideration commands good bad In Pope commands Catholics worship god Dagon refuse arent disobedient As Society Saint Pius X refusing comply things Pope desires But insufficient label disobedient You nature Papal desires And rub SSPX Popes Vatican II

reason Pope a postVatican II idea Holy Orders According idea episcopal consecration confer jurisdiction I lent article a friend I quoted code canon law support idea The Popes thinking point remains a

pronounced jaypeg a standardized image compression mechanism JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group original committee wrote standard JPEG designed compressing fullcolor grayscale digital images natural realworld scenes It work nonrealistic images cartoons line drawings JPEG handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images handle motion picture compression Standards compressing types images worked committees named JBIG MPEG JPEG lossy meaning image decompression isnt identical originally put The algorithm achieves compression exploiting limitations human eye notably fact small color details arent perceived small details lightanddark Thus JPEG intended compressing images looked humans If plan machineanalyze images small errors introduced JPEG a problem invisible eye A property JPEG degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters This means image maker trade file size output image quality You make extremely small files dont mind poor quality indexing image archives making thumbnail views icons Conversely arent happy output quality default compression setting jack quality satisfied accept lesser compression 2 Why JPEG There good reasons make image files smaller store 24bitperpixel color data 8bitperpixel data Making image files smaller a big win transmitting files networks archiving libraries images Being compress a 2 Mbyte fullcolor file 100 Kbytes makes a big difference disk space transmission time If comparing GIF JPEG size ratio More details If viewing software doesnt support JPEG directly youll convert JPEG format viewing manipulating images Even a JPEGcapable viewer takes longer decode view a JPEG image view image a simpler format GIF instance Thus JPEG essentially a timespace tradeoff give time order store transmit image cheaply Its worth

lot active research area purchase display hardware a view JPEG images With a GIF youre stuck forevermore Its worth mentioning GIFviewing programs include shoddy quantization routines If view a

involve sort superhuman divine Much discussion apply religions What atheism Atheism characterized absence belief existence God Some atheists God exist The referred weak atheist position strong atheism

atheists nonexistence Gods limit atheism specific Gods Christian God making flatout denials But isnt disbelieving God thing believing doesnt exist Definitely Disbelief a proposition means true Not believing true equivalent believing false simply idea true Which brings agnosticism What agnosticism The term agnosticism coined Professor Huxley a meeting Metaphysical Society 1876 He defined agnostic disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin things unknown unknowable Thus agnostic believes God exists Words slippery things language inexact Beware assuming work someones philosophical point view simply fact calls atheist agnostic For people agnosticism weak atheism word atheism referring strong atheism Beware word atheist shades meaning difficult generalize atheists About atheists dont God For isnt case atheists science find universe So philosophical justification basis atheism There philosophical justifications atheism To find a person chooses atheist Many atheists feel idea God presented major religions essentially selfcontradictory logically impossible a God exist Others atheists scepticism evidence God exists But isnt impossible prove nonexistence There counterexamples a statement For simple prove exist a prime number larger prime numbers Of deals welldefined objects obeying welldefined rules Whether Gods universes similarly welldefined a matter debate However assuming moment existence a God provably impossible subtle reasons assuming nonexistence God If assume exist show assumption invalid finding a single counterexample If hand assume exist thing question provably impossible showing assumption invalid require exhaustive search places a thing found show isnt Such exhaustive search impractical impossible There problem largest primes prove dont exist Therefore generally accepted assume things exist evidence Even theists follow rule time dont unicorns conclusively prove unicorns exist To assume God exists make assumption tested We make exhaustive search God prove doesnt exist So sceptical atheist assumes default God exist assumption test Those profess strong atheism claim sort God exists generally restrict claims cover varieties God followers religions So whilst impossible prove conclusively God exists prove a God a religious book exist It prove God presentday religion exists In practice believing God religion exists close believing God exists However sufficiently counterarguments based impossibility disproving kind God applicable But God essentially nondetectable If God interacts universe effects interaction measurable Hence interaction universe detectable If God essentially nondetectable case interact universe Many atheists argue God interact universe importance exists If Bible believed God

heavy metal backwards prefer a Verdi Requiem words They wear Hawaiian shirts dress black wear orange robes Many Buddhists lack a belief sort God Some atheists carry a copy Bible arguing Whoever chances met atheists realising Atheists unexceptional behaviour appearance Unexceptional But arent atheists moral religious people That depends If define morality obedience God atheists moral dont obey God But talks morality talks acceptable unacceptable wrong behaviour society Humans social animals maximally successful cooperate This a good reason discourage atheists antisocial immoral behaviour purely purposes selfpreservation Many atheists behave a moral compassionate simply feel a natural tendency empathize humans So care They dont simply Naturally people behave immorally atheism justify actions However equally people behave immorally religious beliefs justify actions For Here a trustworthy deserves full acceptance Jesus Christ world save sinners But reason I shown mercy Jesus Christ display His unlimited patience receive eternal life Now king eternal immortal invisible God honor glory forever The quote a statement made court February 17th 1992 Jeffrey Dahmer notorious cannibal serial killer Milwaukee Wisconsin It atheist massmurderer a religious massmurderer But trivial morality A survey conducted Roper Organization found behavior deteriorated born experiences While 4 respondents driven intoxicated born 12 conversion Similarly 5 illegal drugs conversion 9 Two percent admitted engaging illicit sex salvation 5 Freethought Today September 1991 p 12 So religion a monopoly moral behaviour Is a thing atheist morality If Is a thing morality atheists answer explained Many atheists ideas morality strong held religious people If Does atheism a characteristic moral code answer Atheism imply a person behave Most atheists follow moral rules theists reasons Atheists view morality created humans humans feel world work a set rules decreed a supernatural Then arent atheists theists denying God A study Freedom From Religion Foundation found 90 atheists responded atheists religion work They found religious beliefs fundamentally incompatible observed Atheists unbelievers ignorance denial unbelievers choice The vast majority spent time studying religions great depth They made a careful considered decision reject religious beliefs This decision inevitable consequence individuals personality For a naturally sceptical person choice atheism makes sense choice person honestly make But dont atheists God Atheists live lives watching Many desire watched matter goodnatured Big Brother figure Some atheists God Should things true The risks approach obvious Atheists decide wanting evidence belief But atheists evidence existence God unwilling souls Many atheists previously religious As explained vast majority considered possibility God exists Many atheists spent time prayer reach God Of true atheists lack open mind assuming atheists biased insincere offensive closedminded Comments Of God arent properly viewed patronizing Certainly engage philosophical debate atheists vital give benefit doubt assume sincere searched God If basically telling truth debate futile Isnt life completely pointless atheist Many atheists live a purposeful life They decide meaning life pursue goals They make lives count wishing eternal life influence people live For atheist dedicate life political reform hope leaving mark history It a natural human tendency meaning purpose random events However means obvious life sort thing a meaning To put a question a thing Some atheists What meaning life silly What meaning a cup coffee They life purpose meaning So atheists find comfort time danger There ways obtaining comfort family friends pets Or a spiritual level food drink TV That sound empty vulnerable face danger Should individuals things comforting face reality matter harsh In end a decision individual concerned Most atheists unable makes feel comfortable They put truth comfort searching truth makes feel unhappy hard luck Dont atheists worry suddenly shown wrong The short answer No Many atheists atheists years They encountered arguments supposed evidence existence God found invalid inconclusive Thousands years religious belief havent resulted good proof existence God Atheists tend feel proved wrong future stop worrying So theists question beliefs Dont arguments apply No beliefs questioned similar Weak atheism sceptical default position asserts Strong atheism a negative belief Theism a strong positive belief Atheists argue theists question beliefs real harm believers What sort harm Religion represents a huge financial work burden mankind Its a matter religious believers wasting money church buildings time effort spent building

believers murder children children atheists marry a religion Those werent REAL believers They claimed believers sort excuse What makes a real believer There One True Religions hard Look Christianity competing groups convinced true Christians Sometimes fight kill How atheist supposed decide whos a REAL Christian isnt major Christian churches Catholic Church Church England decide In end atheists a pragmatic view decide calls a Christian Christian belief dogma justify actions considered a Christian Maybe Christians perverting Christian teaching ends surely Bible readily support unChristian acts a moral code If Bible word God couldnt made easy misinterpret And beliefs arent a perversion God intended If single unambiguous interpretation Bible atheist interpretation sayso Sorry claims believes Jesus murdered Jesus Bible told call a Christian Obviously extreme sorts beliefs questioned But proved God exist basic religious beliefs shared faiths nonsense That hold pointed start dialogue positive assertions existence entities inherently harder disprove negative Nobody proved unicorns dont exist doesnt make myths It valid hold a negative assertion default hold a positive assertion default Of weak atheists argue asserting Well atheisms great theists Unfortunately popularity a belief correct works people astrology graphology pseudosciences Many atheists feel simply a human weakness gods Certainly primitive human societies religion people deal phenomena adequately understand Of religion In industrialized world find people believing religious explanations phenomena perfectly adequate natural explanations Religion started a means attempting explain world nowadays serves purposes But cultures developed religions Surely Not Most religions superficially similar

Isaiah 421825 4820 493 We Matthew cutandpasted a portion Isaiahs verse suit gospel More altered words make fit people didnt understand Jesuss stories And Isaiahs verses prophecies commands Gd present Once Matthews prophecy falls flat face Matthew make Jesuss parables prophetic approval Mt 1335 a parable This fulfil spoken prophet I open mouth parables I utter hidden foundation world Matthew botches He attempts quote a prophet Psalms Ps 7824 I open mouth parable I utter dark sayings things heard things fathers told We hide children coming generation glorious deeds lord As pointed verses Psalms a prophet You earlier copies Matthews gospel inserted Isaiahs prophet Apparently scribes caught error cover Perhaps significant part Matthew altered Old Testament Scriptures As Jesus earlier speaks parables understand The parables Psalms hidden Further speak things fathers told Jesus deals things hidden foundation world Indeed Jesus dealt a lot secrecy confusion This direct opposition parables Psalms No Matthew rewrite And Matthews artificial prophecies fall flat face But Christians rarely Matthews prophecies arent things Christianity beginning bad Excuses Little Faith In Mt 171421 disciples casting demons case Not knowing epilepsy people thought disease possesed demons It disciples unable dispossess epileptic But Jesus enlightened reported rebuked didnt faith This strange Why demon special It a true believer faith Apparently faith move mountains Of find days move real mountains No parts seas The miracles Charismatics speak rumoured happen trips Mexico faraway place Major miracles making womans arthritis feel Sunday morning TV And gods including Jesus shrouded ancient lore writings protected skeptics sacred pasts They dead sleeping hiding heaven people rumouring

world good compassion human hearts love men women forgiveness practised Christian Atheist alike beauty created mind man These things But faith Jesus Rides Ass Shortly accepting role Jewish messiah king Jesus requests a donkey brought ride Jerusalem Mt 215 This place fulfil spoken prophet Tell daughter Zion Behold king coming humble mounted ass a asscolt Of passage quoted Zechariah 99 reads a differently Lo king triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations There isnt difference Zechariah involves animal asscolt Matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently Thus Jesus call a colt adult ass From Matthews version a comical picture divine Christ sweating straddle donkeys This inevitably lead a theological proctological dilemma We find account written earlier St Mark colt called brought Jesus This fits verses Zechariah properly shows Matthew attempt prophetic verses bungled Now excluding respectable Christians I met I noticed Christ thought ridden asses situation reversed nowadays Then entering Jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling Jesus messiah But Jesus replied expect Matthew Mt 2116 Havent read Out mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise It Matthew made response Jesus point prophetic things AND expect quote error fit Matthews track record We Jesus Matthew Havent read source reads Psalms 812 O YaHWeH lord majestic world You glory chanted heavens babes infants founded a bulwark foes enemy avenger The passages comment There perfect praise spoken psalm praise Gd messiah king Jesus As mentioned case Matthews pen making convenient prophetic scripture YHVH lord Jesus asked promised Jewish messiahking descended The Jews agree king David But Jesus counters quoting Psalms 110 The LORD Lord sit hand I put enemies feet Taken face Jesus denying necessity Davidic descent One assumes opposition answer Of Christian answer agrees make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiahking Its tempting a Christian interested matters investigation But problems In Jesuss time psalm thought messiah And easy David refer messiah superior We scriptures messiah expected a great king bringing Jews times Davids rule Of Jews listening good answer passage refer a divine messiah Christians worship The problem lies meaning psalm error apparently Jews Jesuss time made One remember factions Jews a result expectations messiahking Jesus apparently adventists audience thought messiahs advent imminent interpreted Psalms 110 messianic What problem Psalm 110 literally reads YHVHs utterance lord Sit hand I make enemies footstool YHVH sends mighty scepter Zion Rule midst foes Your people offer freely day lead host holy mountains You a priest order Melchizedek forever The word lord mistakenly capitalised Christian bibles denote divinity lord But Hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists Adoni simply means lord a generic term It scriptures refer kings Gd It address respect There text imply word refers divinity messiahking That supposed written David The title psalm translates a psalm David a psalm David It fitting assume written a court poet Davids covenant endorsement Gd If psalm written David talking messiah The idea a perfect king descended David present Davids age We extensive tales Davids doings sayings include praises a messiah Many psalms show evidence written long David dead times exile Gd put show favour Davids kingdom hold The description psalm fit David David promised Gd a rise power victory enemies successful judgement nations conquered He achieved priesthood common Melchizedek a righteous king enabled bless people It fits We blame problem Matthew Here artificial prophecy alluded scripture questionable Still event common gospels So Matthew a easily time It interesting note Matthew dresses event The earlier gospel Mark tells tale Jesus simply speaking a crowd Matthew Pharisees religious competition infant Christianity target Jesuss question As expect Matthew writes event ends embarrassing Pharisees Such power pen Moses Jesus Had Together All Along We leave gospel story Matthew momentarily a pseudoprophecy Johns gospel The gospel story John deserves special treatment removed real events Jesuss career told Matthew But moment verse The early church leaders founded a religion Jewish hopes a messiah king artificial extension original promises made Gd When constructing history Abraham Moses wrote a promise land nationhood Jewish people While accomplished eventually rule king David Christians decided claim fulfillment promise But expanded promise preaching a heavenly kingdom John 856 JC speaking Your father Abraham rejoiced My day He glad It nice tie approval Jesus Abraham Abraham knew Jesus a messiah Christian I failed find event Old Testament corresponds Johns prophecy It par St John making Old Testament backings forerunner Matthew Many Christians faith foundations fraud surprising cling The Potters Field We told Jesus betrayed Jerusalem followers Judas Iscariot Matthew writes Mt 27510 And throwing pieces silver temple Judas departed But chief priests taking silver It isnt lawful put treasury blood money So bought a potters field bury strangers Then fulfilled spoken prophet Jeremiah And thirty pieces silver price a price set sons Israel gave potters field lord directed This prophecy utterly gross bastardisation Old Testament Scripture First Matthew made a mistake prophet It Zechariah utters verses Matthew makes Zech 111213 And weighed wages thirty shekels silver Then YHVH Cast treasury lordly price I paid So I thirty shekels silver cast treasury house YHVH First verses Zechariah deal a betrayer messiah Gd The deal a shepherd a priest chosen serve a function presiding people shortly Gd send Judah Israel conflict The word treasury replaced King James Scholars potter precisely made Matthews quote fit But a blatant error The correct translation Hebrew treasury makes perfect sense Zechariahs context potters field totally unrelated Whether mistranslation intentional speculation However Matthews track record finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty Of Matthew ample reason altering text The thirty pieces silver match Judass situation Christians reader disregard contextual incongruity Matthew prophecy toss However correct translation Zechariah directly contradicts situation Judas high priests The high priests put money treasury The worthless shepherd Zechariah opposite Of average ThursdayNight Bible student prophecy presented Matthew New Testament face To Matthews work convincing Wine Vinegar Casting Lots Then Jesus led crucified Mt 273435 gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted drink And crucified divided garments casting lots fulfilled spoken prophet They parted garments vesture cast lots First vinegar offered Jesus common sour wine type Roman soldiers drank regularly We find Jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall Jn 192830 Jesus I thirst A bowl vinegar stood put a sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth When received vinegar It finished But Matthew drawing a passage prophets Psalms Ps 692028 I looked pity comforters I found They gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink Add punishment punishment acquittal thee Let blotted Book Living Of sour wine offered Jesus request drink This a show pity The psalm quoted David political military enemies It messiah Jesus It surprising run problem Jesus psalm asks Gd damnation crucifiers Jesus gospels Lk 2334 Jesus Father forgive dont Further Matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall a bitter substance put Jesuss drink meat psalm stipulates With prophecy vinegar faulty naturally What casting lots This brings 22nd Psalm deserves discussion Suffice fact Jesuss clothes divided told great thing It turns happened felon days As erroneous passage psalm applied Jesus It bring interesting question quality Jesuss clothes For a man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions The 22nd Psalm This psalm attributed David a lament condition attack enemies It a song praise YHVH hope Taken context parts fit plight Jesus crucifixion We examine primary passages Verse 12 My god god forsaken Why helping words groaning Oh god I cry day dont answer night find rest Jesus cried sentence cross This suggests psalm Jesus king David Of rest stanza fit nicely Jesus execution Jesus pictured complaining ordeal supposed lamb led mute shearers Indeed Jesus doesnt groaning cross He cry day night cross 68 But I a worm man scorned men All mock They make faces wag heads He committed YHVH So deliver delights This fit Jesuss execution pretty exception Holy messiah called a worm 1213 Many bulls encompass open mouths widely a ravening roaring lion 1618 Yea dogs round a company evildoers encircle pierced hands feet I bones They divide garments cast lost raiment 1921 But YHVH Deliver soul sword life power dog Save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull It convincing Im early Christian fathers wrote prophecy thought Unfortunately prophecy a fatal flaw The words pierced exist psalm The correct Hebrew translation 16 Yea dogs round a company evildoers encircles lion hands feet In Hebrew phrase lion a rare verb form pierced differ phonetic character The word Hebrew text literally lion kaari makes sense context fits animal imagery employed psalm writer It convenience urge a Christian change word kaaru But add needed artificial weight prophecy Christian translators chosen While correct translation eliminate psalm referring Jesus absence honesty translators Apart erroneous verse 16 psalm lend Jesus easily Verse 20 speaks sufferer saved a sword a cross This naturally fits psalms true subject king David As a side note crucifixions pierce hands palms forearms This doesnt favour traditional thought a resurrected Jesus showing disciples scars palms But facts arent bound religious beliefs Matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw direct links psalm lord Jesus But psalm minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations Jesuss life death How scriptures contributed written a question repercussions Christian theology It easy faithful fundamentalists events New Testament enhanced scribes eager Matthew But speculate simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims So good things St Matthew The reference piercing a lot Jesuss crucifixion Johns gospel recount written 70 years fact tells Jesuss execution Jn 193437 But soldiers pierced side a spear blood water things place Scripture fulfilled The theyve pierced Of built a passage blatantly context Prophet Zechariah tells nation Israel split Jerusalem Judah war Zc 12710 And YHVH give victory Judah And day I seek destroy nations Jerusalem Judah And I pour a spirit compassion supplication Jerusalem pierced mourn weep bitterly weep a firstborn child Johns attempt make prophecy weaker Matthews attempts Matthew excontexts passage Johns errors grossly obvious blatant It speak gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded Reckoned Transgressors After arrest Jesus quickly executed claiming Jewish kingship messiahship According version gospel tale Jesus executed thieves Mk 1527 And crucified robbers left And scripture fulfilled He reckoned transgressors Here Mark link Jesus a passage Isaiah 53 servant nation Israel The passage messiah reads chapter Isaiah 53 surrounding chapters sees servant a nation The verses servant past a prediction event The servant thought a criminal This fit description Jesus Had passage messiah clear executing Jesus thieves fulfill prophecy Isaiah Jesus fittingly fulfill ministry He considered a blasphemer troublemaker career Locking a single event a poor steal prophecy case Mark made a analogy general comparisons Mark crucified Jesus reviled 1532 This expected a couple robbers Of recount St Luke decides change things Luke tells Lk 233943 And criminals hanged railed Arent messiah Save This fits Marks recount tells people crucified Jesus Save robbers But Luke But criminal rebuked Dont fear Gd sentence condemnation And justly receiving due reward deeds But man wrong And Jesus remember kingdom And Jesus answered Verily I today paradise Now dialogue highly contrived It stretches imagination a bit picture ruffian rebuking fellow criminal eloquent speech We a strange picture a criminal lamenting goodness punishment justness suffering Such a man apparently noble principle doesnt a robber We amount theatrics created Luke Of Lukes recount disagrees Marks Luke criminal revile Jesus It easy discount discrepancy account made part error free words Gd avenue open This a writer Old Testament passage expand reinterpret suit theology In case embroidery creates embarrassing problems The End World Mt 24 Now extraordinary embarrassing passages New Testament It found synoptic gospel stories casts unfavourable doubt theory Christianity Jesus mentions destruction Jewish temples buildings disciples end world warning The disciples Tell temples destruction sign coming close age Jesus Take care leads astray I christ hear wars rumours wars place end For nation rise nation beginning birthpangs They deliver put death false prophets arise lead astray But endures end saved This gospel preached world a testimony nations end So desolation spoken prophet Daniel Judea flee mountains Immediately tribulation days sun darkened stars fall heaven sign Son Man heaven tribes earth mourn Son Man coming send angels gather elect Learn lesson fig tree branch tender puts leaves summer So things He gate Truly I generation pass things place But day hour angels Son Father Therefore ready Son Man coming hour expect From clear Jesus thought world lifetimes disciples He tells doesnt exact day hour ready Theologians wet pants panic find Holy Error But Jesus made explicit He told disciples generation End prepare prepare swept There resorted removing inerrant nature Bible phrase generation pass means race people pass Of word generation times refer generation disciples It interesting notion God decided learn Greek didnt learn make clear But obvious rest dialogue disciples supposed live End World The charge mistranslation completely blown Apostles responses It abundantly clear Rev 227 1 Peter 47 1 John 218 Rev 2220 Jesus meant The End For 2000 years Christians rationalised 24th chapter Matthew meaning altogether For 2000 years waited executed leader back hearing wars rumours wars He coming Surely He All wait Can imagine tired He sitting holy waiting moment spring So shortly crucifixion Jesus Nazareth JoshuabenJoseph died It days days nights periods time eternal seconds decide makes trouble resurrected glowing divine radiance Then Saviour decided wasnt interests religion stick disappeared sight heaven So story As things attributed Jesus people writing gospel stories To Jesus fulfiller prophecy scripture We matter shaky But Church history Christians held fast faith simple belief What doctrinal objections solved argumentation brute force faith forgetfulness question To question investigate easiest treat matters Thus 2000 years prophecies cited New Testament largely accepted Things continue time Pausing a moment doctrines Christianity accepted properly improperly support wars persecution I suppose prophecy Christianity securely hold Mt 1034

From dlecointgarnetacnsfsuedu Darius_Lecointe Subject Re Sabbath Admissions 5of5 Organization Florida State University Lines 227 Someone FAQ Email I post response Im enforcing inclusion limits FAQ readers havent clh Christ warns breaks commandments teaches otheres called kingdom heaven Matt 519 This FAQ full error I respond I hope maintains remove partisan theology Brothers Sisters Being faith examining Decalogue closely Ive noticed fourth commandment pretty specific keeping Sabbath day It states 7th day Saturday Sabbath Christian religions atleast church Sunday Whats This a frequently asked question Every time arises months debate So I answer directly Basically Law Moses part a specific covenanent Jews Most arent Jews arent part covenant There argument early Christian history Mosaic laws apply Gentiles Christians You account debate Acts 15 The main question circumcision keeping Sabbath part The apostles concluded Jews order Christians rules circumcision apply 1 The law man revealed Mount Sinai Rom 415 notes law transgression Not sin exist Sinai Eden Sabbath revealed Sinai Ex 16 2 The problem covenant law promise undergirded God wanted perform lives people ignorance 400 years slavery promised He That covenant based promises Heb 86 Rather law God promised put laws minds write hearts Heb 810 3 Including Sabbath Acts 15 selective inclusion The Sabbath important Jews circumcision If attempt made Sabbath reaction strident recorded Acts 15 Do confuse weekly Sabbath Decalogue ceremonial sabbaths occur time week part law ceremonial added transgression moral law Gal 319 4 Israel stands Gods people time That God grafted Gentiles Roma 94 adoption glory covenants giving law service God promises belong Israelites In explanation Paul makes clear born Israel For Israel Israel v 6 Then Gal 319 ye Christs ye Abrahams seed heirs promise All Christians Abrahams seed Jews Israelites Not physically criterion spiritually We joint heirs Jesus based promise God made people Israelites While Christians agree OT Laws apply part a specific covenanent Jews expect similarity things God expected Jews things expects After God However ways dealing These days common approach separate OT commandments moral ceremonial Ceremonial commandments apply Jews They part specific Mosaic covenant These thinsg kosher laws circumcision Moral laws apply Most 10 commands part moral law commandment Sabbath I people approach specific requirement worship Sabbath part ceremonial law a general obligation worship regularly part general moral law Thus Christians free choose specific time worship People agree wrong How Sabbath commandment ceremonial part a law predates ceremonial laws You free choose time worship Even follow a day worship origins pagan sun worship Would give a day God blessed sanctified hallowed exchange church leaders agree biblical foundation Sabbath Admissions socreligionchristianbiblestudy A radical approach generally connected John Calvin Reformed tradition Law a longer binding Instead grace behavior guided solely love Portions OT Law guidance But properly speaking legally binding In practice people position safe leave Christians moral guidannce While longer Law sinners safe situations principles guide Were good selfjustification safe Thus Christians moral guidance things Jesus teachings Pauls advice These precisely a Law serve function largely content moral law previous analysis While Calvin deny a fixed legal responsibility worship specific day human weakness discipline regular worship important I care Calvin theologian My guide God If law means law section law trouble Sabbath commandment God thought important REMEMBER If study word deeply note message longer condemnation law freed grace God If a cop pulls speeding court I mercy judge throw book grace I walk court I speeding I grace Being grace I drive speed limit Paul adds Rom 331 Di make void law faith God forbid yea establish law Wherefore law holy commandment holy good Rom 712 In analyses specific day issue As a matter tradition worship Sunday a memorial Christs resurrection Theres debate Acts shows early Christian worship The common analysis shows Jewish Christians continuing Jewish services Sabbath specifically Christian service necessarily held Act 207 shows worship day Sunday I Cor 162 implies gatherings day There a groups continue Christians worship Sabbath Saturday The bestknown SeventhDay Adventists Jehovahs Witnesses They argue Act 207 a regular worship service a special meeting Paul I Cor 162 doesnt explicitly a regular worship service Do prefer implication fact A careful study Acts 20 shows meeting Saturday night Sunday morning Paul a worship service set a long journey foot Assos In ICor 16 equate lay store a worship service Its clear issue a contested Pauls time See Rom 145 Pauls advice careful judging issues One person sees a specific day mandated God He observes specific day honor Lord He believes worship free restrictions honor Lord Those Sabbath mandated argue Paul referring Sabbath worship Note Col 216 similar briefer It explicitly mentions Sabbath Wrong These sabbath days ceremonial law Sabbath day moral law There differences Christians word Sabbath Originally term referred 7th Day Jewish day worship Many Christians refer Sunday day Christian worship They largely apply 4th a couple numbering schemes commandment Reformed tradition It distinguishes Sabbath observance mandated Jews Lords Day free Christian worship The reference I find NT Rev 110 There differences laws day Many Christians support blue laws secular law church law setting day causing people spend worship The radical antilegal approach sees regulations a return Jewish Sabbath free Christian worship Lords Day Why prefer twist turn relying arguments conflict obey a simple request a God loved die Jesus died law changed Why bother die order meet demands a broken law change law Penalties law breaking means law immutable That sin follow demands ceremonial laws It a sin make false gods violate Gods break Sabbath steal kill Except disagree But opinion weight word God Darius Its clear FAQ I Pauls comments esteeming day Rom 14 I accept Darius honor Lord I equally accept esteem days alike similarly honor Lord However Id clear I unambiguous proof regular Christian worship day As I responses passages cited The difficulty passages They talking nnregular Christian meetings explicitly gathered Sunday worship We pieces information aimed answering question Act 226 describes Christians participating Jewish temple worship Christian communion services homes Obviously temple worship Sabbath Acts 1344 Christians participating Unfortunately doesnt day Christians met houses Acts 207 Darius confusion Acts occuring Sunday I reason impose modern definitions days start Biblical text clear meant The wording implies a normal meeting It doesnt gathered Paul gathered breaking bread Paul talked upcoming travel But explicit convincing Similarly 1 Cor 162 It day set money Pauls collection Now gathered specially homes I disprove obvious time a congregation offering gather worship expected homes reason mention a specific day So I obvious reading day week simply means time gather worship I reason implications clear statements NT authors assumed readers knew Christian worship clh
