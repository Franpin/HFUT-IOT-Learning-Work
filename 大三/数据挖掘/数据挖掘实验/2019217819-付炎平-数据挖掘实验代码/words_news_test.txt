Boswell considered possibility term derives form meaning Leviticus passages 129 This significant term derived refutes Boswells claim half word arseno denotes object gender half koitai The LXX a male sleeps a male making arseno object Wright faults Boswells claims linguistic features term including suggested parallels 129 Though Boswell claims compounds arseno employ objectively arreno employ

lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters This means image maker trade file size output image quality You make extremely small files dont mind poor quality indexing image archives making

improvements quantization algorithms a lot active research area purchase display hardware a view JPEG images With a GIF youre stuck forevermore Its worth mentioning GIFviewing programs include shoddy quantization routines If view a 256color GIF a 16color EGA display a worse image This partly inevitable consequence color quantizations create GIF display due sloppiness JPEG conversion programs

Group original committee wrote standard JPEG designed compressing fullcolor grayscale digital images natural realworld scenes It work nonrealistic images cartoons line drawings JPEG handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images handle motion picture compression Standards compressing types images worked committees named JBIG MPEG JPEG lossy meaning image decompression isnt identical originally put The algorithm achieves compression exploiting limitations human eye notably fact small color details arent perceived small details lightanddark Thus JPEG intended compressing images looked humans If plan machineanalyze images small errors introduced JPEG a problem invisible eye A property JPEG degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters This means image maker trade file size output image quality You make extremely small files dont mind poor quality indexing image archives making thumbnail views icons Conversely arent happy output quality default compression

display hardware Typical display hardware stores 8 fewer bits pixel display 256 fewer distinct colors a time To display a fullcolor image computer map image set representative colors This process called color quantization This a misnomer color selection a term Were stuck standard usage Clearly color quantization a lossy process It turns images details color quantization algorithm MUCH impact final image quality errors introduced JPEG lowest JPEG quality settings Since JPEG a fullcolor format converting a color JPEG image display 8bitorless hardware requires color quantization This true color JPEGs feed a 256orlesscolor GIF JPEG decompressor 256 colors thousands colors This JPEGs lossiness affects pixel a differently pixels started identical colors slightly colors Each original color smeared a group nearby colors Therefore quantization required display a color JPEG a colormapped display image source The avoid quantization grayscale output Incidentally effect meaningless talk number colors a JPEG image Even attempted count number distinct pixel values JPEG decoders give results roundoff error differences I occasionally posted images 256color JPEG This tells poster a hasnt read FAQ b converted JPEG a GIF JPEGs classified color grayscale photographs number colors isnt a concept JPEG On hand a GIF image definition quantized 256 fewer colors A GIF a definite number colors palette format doesnt 256 palette entries For purposes Usenet picture distribution GIF advantage sender precomputes color quantization recipients dont This disadvantage GIF youre stuck senders quantization If sender quantized a number colors display requantize resulting poorer image quality quantized a fullcolor image Furthermore sender didnt a highquality color quantization algorithm youre luck For reason JPEG offers promise significantly image quality users machines dont match senders display hardware JPEGs full color image quantized precisely match users display hardware Furthermore advantage future improvements quantization algorithms a lot active research area purchase display hardware a view JPEG images With a GIF youre stuck forevermore Its worth mentioning GIFviewing programs include shoddy quantization routines If view a 256color GIF a 16color EGA display a worse image This partly inevitable consequence color quantizations create GIF display due sloppiness JPEG conversion programs forced high quality quantizers order acceptable results normal quantize directly number colors displayed Thus JPEG provide results average GIF program lowcolorresolution displays

discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization Huffman arithmetic entropy coding This articles long Im For technical information compcompression FAQ This newsanswers archive rtfmmitedu files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart13 If newsanswers archive top article 9 What lossless JPEG Theres a great deal confusion subject The JPEG committee define a lossless compression algorithm guarantees final output bitforbit identical original input However lossless mode common regular lossy JPEG algorithm offers compression At present implementations lossless JPEG exist commercial Saying Q 100 free JPEG software DOES NOT a lossless image What rid deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step There a good deal information loss color subsampling step With V4 free JPEG code

lossless images JPEG lossless superior JBIG images 6 bits pixel JPEG public domain a Huffman back end JBIG techniques heavily covered patents 10 Why argument file formats Strictly speaking JPEG refers a family compression algorithms refer a specific image file format The JPEG committee prevented defining a file format turf wars international standards organizations Since exchange images agree a common file format leaves a problem In absence official standards a number JPEG program writers thing a result programs arent compatible elses The closest thing a defacto standard JPEG format work

arithmetic coding obtain licenses companies The fair doctrine people implement test algorithm storing images dubious At short run I recommend people worry arithmetic coding space savings isnt great justify potential legal hassles In arithmetic coding images exchanged Usenet There small chance legal situation change future Stay tuned details 13 Does loss accumulate repeated

Christians homosexuality genital sex wrong Not A denominations accept The Metropolitan Community Churches bestknown formed specifically accept homosexuals However United Church Christ I a couple groups The Episcopal Church accept areas In churches congregational government youll find a congregations accept Southern Baptists number congregations But unusual churches permit homosexual church leaders How carefully enforce issue I dont doubt homosexual pastors denomination open As arguments Biblical issues heres attempt summarize issues The commonly cited reference favoring acceptance homosexuality previous discussions John Boswell Christianity Social Tolerance Homosexuality U Chicago Press 1980 The argument pretty clear There explicit laws OT Leviticus 2013 Rom 1 Paul pretty negative homosexuality Beyond references debates Some passages cited subject relevant Eg sin inhabitants Sodom proposed carry homosexual rape homosexual activity consenting adults Theres question homosexual entities involved angels It horrifying involved guests responsibility guests culture strong This reason Lot offered daughter give daughter guests attacked If a concordance references Sodom Bible youll imply homosexuality sin Theres a Jewish interpretive tradition major sin abuse guests At rate debate homosexual rape wrong I discuss Leviticus law part a set laws Christians binding So NT justification found Lev settle issue The NT references Pauls letters A number references Paul lists sins words fairly vague Boswell argues words occuring lists homosexual Heres The Greek words lists I Cor 69 I Tim 110 malakos arsenokoitai Unfortunately clear words malakos a basic meaning soft a variety metaphorical meanings ethical writing Boswell suggests wanton a equivalent He reports unanimous interpretation Church including Greekspeaking Christians passage referred masturbation a meaning vanished 20th Cent practice frownedupon He cites references late 1967 edition Catholic Encyclopedia identify masturbation He translates arsenokotai male prostitute giving evidence church fathers understood term referring homosexuality general A technical meaning suggested early Latin translations active mode homosexual male prostitute view Paul intend technically For a conservative view I consulted Gordon Fees commentary I Cor He cites evidence malakos meant effeminate However Boswell warns Greek culture effeminate necessarily synonymous homosexual kinds homosexual behavior Given Boswell Fee I suspect term simply definite applies homosexuals cases isnt a general term homosexuality While Fee argues Boswell arsenokotai ends suggesting a translation essentially The big problem word Pauls writing occurence The fact word composed male fk doesnt meaning doesnt male subject object action Examples compound words formed In theory refer rapists Its dangerous base meaning purely etymology youll conclude goodbye a religious expression based God ye However Boswell Fee NIV agree homosexual male prostitute good a guess Note translation misses strong vulgarity term Fee Boswell agree attempt reproduce translation In opinion strongest NT reference homosexuality Romans 1 Boswell points Rom 1 speaks homosexuality happened people naturally heterosexual a result corruption due worshipping false gods One argue simply a homosexual worshipped false gods fall degradation heterosexual However I find argument forced fact homosexual readers proposed Paul meant However I convinced Rom 1 sufficient create a law homosexuality Christians What Paul describing Rom 1 homosexuality Christians homosexuality appeared idolaters part a package wickedness Despite impression left impassioned rhetoric Im Paul pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex Given description situation I assume heterosexual sex debased shameless So I passage a negative view homosexuality But fairness shameless nature acts a reflection general spiritual state people a specific feature homosexuality My view situation I evidence confident Paul disapproved homosexuality Rom 1 clear While I Cor 69 I Tim 110 unambiguous general condemnations homosexuality wording approved homosexuality considered acceptable cases On hand passages explicit teachings subject Rom 1 idolatry It refers homosexuality passing The result situation people interpret passages light general approach Scripture For Scripture laws issues surprising passages NT endorsement OT prohibition For approach Bible liberal surprising regard Pauls negative view homosexuality Jewish upbringing reexamination light Gospel As readers group assumptions approaches radically people tend foam mouth opposing view Theres a lot I moderator a situation A number discussions past centered sort detailed exegesis texts However fact Im convinced defenders homosexuality base beliefs analyses The real issue rest question Pauls judgement apply modern homosexuality One commonly made claim Paul simply faced kinds questions deal He encountered homosexuality contexts people agree wrong He faced experience Christians act straight fail faced Christians define a Christian homosexuality fits general Christian ideals fidelity sexuality a mirror relationship God man It unfair Pauls judgement homosexuality idolaters make judgements questions Another In Pauls time homosexuality a number things Christians find acceptable It part temple prostitution Among private citizens occured adults children free people slaves Im a position reasons The ancients distinguished active passive partner It considered disgraceful a free adult act passive partner This reason active mode homosexual prostitute considered disgraceful His customers people enjoyed passive role This supports idea tend engaged free adult males degree scandal Clearly Christian homosexuals condone sex children slaves a position fully responsible partners However Fees commentary I Cor cites examples ancient literature homosexual relationships involve free adults a symmetrical Thus considerations paragraph shouldnt pushed Homosexuality discredited Jews associations surely cases prostitutes involve slaves children Some people argued AIDS a judgement homosexuality Id point AIDS transmitted promiscuous sex homosexual heterosexual Someone a homosexual relationship meets Christian criteria marriage risk AIDS Note good reason Pauls general approach doubt concede homosexuality a fully equal alternative specific statements homosexuality I Genesis story lead regard heterosexual marriage God ordained However Paul deals pastoral questions a warning quick deal issue legally I claim question counsel homosexual Christians a theological issue a pastoral Pauls tendency issues eating meat celebrating holidays uncompromising principle pastoral issues carefully good people involved avoid insisting perfection personally damaging For Paul believed acceptable eat meat wanted avoid pushing people action personal qualms For Paul preferred people circumstances remain unmarried Yet unable married a state tempted fornication I a view accepting views Paul expressed Rom 1 One homosexuality God intended occured a result sin conclude times live Note creation story work enters human life a result sin This doesnt Christians stop working saved The question homosexuality sinful a misfortune a broad sense due human sinfulness If youre approach a pastoral judgement damage caused finding a live cure The dangers cure attempt fails end damage ranging psychological damage suicide broken marriages attempts living a heterosexual fail This depend assessment inherent nature homosexuality If a wrong run high risks damage rid Clearly generally suggest people live a tendency steal drug addiction attempts cure conditions difficult However conditions intrinsically damaging a obvious homosexuality Many problems homosexuality problems promiscuity homosexuality This includes AIDS I granted sort homosexual relationships a Christian allowing equivalent Christian heterosexual relationships In discussing decade weve heard a lot personal testimony fellow Christians situation Ive summaries research results efforts conversion Aside Presbyterian report mentioned FAQ summarizes readers reports question The evidence longterm success changing orientation rare a par healing miracles The danger advising Christians depend a change clear When conversion doesnt happen people left despair feeling excluded a Church a requirement lifelong celibacy Paul recognized a context a demand practical people I history clerical celibacy strongly reinforced judgement The practical result homosexuals end gay sex clubs rest sordid side homosexuality Maybe homosexuality isnt Gods original ideal I imagine Paul preferring people longterm committed Christian relationships promiscuity As work Genesis suggests wasnt part Gods original ideal I relationships a vehicle people sharing Gods love Theres issue Biblical interpretation underlying discussion The issue cultural relativism That Paul wrong eternal statement things wrong specific situations culture time Conservative Christians generally insist taking prohibitions absolute Bible subjective stop relative When issue worth noting completely rejects concept cultural relativism There a number judgements New Testament conservative Christians relative The judgements clear Bible homosexuality prohibition charging interest occurs 18 times OT NT I mention recently Church binding Christians prohibition swearing oaths endorsement slavery institution judgement tax collectors sinner We regard

kind oaths Jesus concerned people Paul simply telling people live slavery endorsing institution people IRS morally equivalent Roman tax farming The point Im make applying Biblical prohibitions 20th Cent 20th Cent actions When Christian homosexuals relationships Greek homosexuality Paul familiar kind argument made judicial oaths tax collectors Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking
